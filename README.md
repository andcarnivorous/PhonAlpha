# Phonalpha

This small package allows to insert into a buffer IPA characters from some preset keybindings and from an interactive IPA chart.

This mode is meant for who wants to insert characters in org or txt files, inserting them in a LaTeX file will not result in the compilation of those characters.

### How to install

git clone this repo in your configuration folder (e.g. .emacs.d)

### How to use

You can call `M-x` `phonalpha-mode` to enable the keybindings.

You can access the ipa-chart with `M-x` `phonalpha-ipa-chart`
